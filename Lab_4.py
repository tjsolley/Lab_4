"""
This program allows a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question
question = "What is the capital of California". The anser is "Sacramento". 
We first set max_tries = 3. Then we create a loop to iterate three times. For each iteration,
we ask the user for the anser (user input). Then based on the answer the user gives, we check  
to see if the user input matches the anser. If so, print "Correct!", then terminate the loop with a
break statement. 
if the user could not guess the correct anser within the max_tries, then print
"You have used up your allotment of guesses.", the print "The correct answer is 'California'".
